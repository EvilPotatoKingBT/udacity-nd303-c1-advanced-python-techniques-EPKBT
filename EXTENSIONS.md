## Deliverables

Query, Inspect, all works and outputs can be saved without issue in CSV and/or JSON as well.
I only modified `models.py`, `read.py`, `database.py`, `filters.py`, and `write.py`. 

### Rubric

However - when I tried to run built in tests, these were failing. I am not sure why, it is probably because to achieve fast runtime, I used extra dictionaries to link NEOs and CloseApproaches.

To double check, I made some tests of mine - counting NEOs/Approaches found, NEOs/Approaches linked and (ultimately unsuccessful debuging to comply with built-ins) cost me few days.

I welcome any help to understand topics more, at this point I need another set of eyes to figure out if my approache was just different, or wrong.

### Final words

I am submitting this project knowing of my shortcomings, but hopeful that with your help I can do better.

Thank you.
